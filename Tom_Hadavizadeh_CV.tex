\section*{Research Interests}
I am a fourth year DPhil student researching with the LHCb experiment and I am interested in pursuing a career in experimental particle physics. My DPhil thesis is centred around searches for rare annihilation topology decays of $B$ mesons, as these could potentially be sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Alongside this I have gained a wide range of skills and experience, including data analysis, software development and in the running of the LHCb experiment. I hope to use these skills to tackle new and more complicated challenges.

\noindent\emph{Research Areas:} 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item {\bf $B^{+}$ meson decays:} Analysed LHCb data taken in Run I and Run II  to search for the rare decays $B^{+} \to D_{s}^{+} \phi$ and $B^{+} \to D_{s}^{+} K^{+} K^{-}$. In the standard model the decay $B^{+} \to D_{s}^{+} \phi$ is dominated by a single annihilation topology diagram, however a number of theories beyond the Standard Model could enhance the branching fraction. The resulting paper has been submitted to JHEP.

\item {\bf $B_{c}^{+}$ meson decays:} Currently performing a search for $B_{c}^{+} \to D_{s}^{(*)+}\phi$  and $B_{c}^{+} \to D^{(*)+}K^{*0}$ decays. This is an important follow up to the recently published $B_{c}^{+} \to D^{0} K^{+}$ observation at LHCb, thought to be dominated by annihilation and penguin topology processes.

\item {\bf Real-time beam size measurements:} Helped develop and maintain an online monitoring task that measures the LHC beam sizes via Beam-Gas interactions with LHCb's VELO detector. A dedicated cross-calibration was performed and the results present as a poster at IPAC 2017.

\item {\bf Developed charm triggers in Run II:} Wrote software triggers dedicated to selecting $D^{+} \to \pi^{+} \pi^{0}$ and similar topology decays. These are reconstructed using $\pi^{0} \to e^{+} e^{-} \gamma$ decays and will be used to produce a CP asymmetry measurement with the Run II dataset.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\emph{Collaboration Responsibilities:} 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item {\bf Charm working group CaloObjects liaison:}  
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Report to the Charm WG about relevant topics and issues affecting calorimeter objects.
\item Perform studies for the CaloObjects group to validate and understand these particles.
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Control room shifts:} 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Performed 18 Shift Leader and 16 Data Manager shifts. \emph{(Ranked 3rd for most data manager shifts in 2016).}
\item These roles are responsible for the safety and quality of the LHCb experiment's running. 
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf LHCb UK Student Meeting committee:} 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Helped organise and run a series of talks aimed at new and current PhD students.
\end{itemize}
